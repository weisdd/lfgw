# Label Filter Gateway (lfgw)

lfgw is a simple reverse proxy aimed at PromQL / MetricsQL metrics filtering based on OIDC roles.

It relies on [VictoriaMetrics/metricsql](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metricsql) for label filters manipulation in metric expressions (according to an [ACL](#acl)) before a request is proxied to Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics by [httputil](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil). The process is described in more details [here](docs/filtering.md).

Target setup: `grafana (with OIDC integration) <-> lfgw <-> Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics`.

## Key features

* ACL-based request rewrites with implicit deny;
* a user can have multiple roles;
* support for autoconfiguration in environments, where OIDC-role names match names of namespaces ("assumed roles" mode; thanks to [@aberestyak](https://github.com/aberestyak/) for the idea);
* [automatic expression optimizations](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metricsql#Optimize) for non-full access requests;
* support for different headers with access tokens (`Authorization`, `X-Forwarded-Access-Token`, `X-Auth-Request-Access-Token`), which can be useful for tools like [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy);
* requests to both `/api/*` and `/federate` endpoints are protected (=rewritten);
* requests to sensitive endpoints are blocked by default;
* compatible with both [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) and [MetricsQL](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/wiki/MetricsQL).

## Configuration

Example of `keycloak + grafana + lfgw` setup is described [here](docs/oidc.md).

### Requirements for jwt-tokens

* OIDC-roles must be present in `roles` claim;
* Client ID specified via `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` must be present in `aud` claim (more details in [environment variables section](#environment-variables)), otherwise token verification will fail.

### Environment variables

| Variable                    | Default Value | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `UPSTREAM_URL`              |               | Prometheus URL, e.g. `http://prometheus.localhost`.          |
| `OIDC_REALM_URL`            |               | OIDC Realm URL, e.g. `https://keycloak.localhost/auth/realms/monitoring` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`            |               | OIDC Client ID (1*)                                          |
| `ACL_PATH`                  | `./acl.yaml`  | Path to a file with ACL definitions (OIDC role to namespace bindings). Skipped if `ACL_PATH` is empty (might be useful when autoconfiguration is enabled through `ASSUMED_ROLES=true`). |
| `ASSUMED_ROLES`             | `false`       | In environments, where OIDC-role names match names of namespaces, ACLs can be constructed on the fly (e.g. `["role1", "role2"]` will give access to metrics from namespaces `role1` and `role2`). The roles specified in `acl.yaml` are still considered and get merged with assumed roles. Role names may contain regular expressions, including the admin definition `.*`. |
| `ENABLE_DEDUPLICATION`      | `true`        | Whether to enable deduplication, which leaves some of the requests unmodified if they match the target policy. Examples can be found in the "acl.yaml syntax" section. |
| `OPTIMIZE_EXPRESSIONS`      | `true`        | Whether to automatically optimize expressions for non-full access requests. [More details](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/VictoriaMetrics/metricsql#Optimize) |
| `SAFE_MODE`                 | `true`        | Whether to block requests to sensitive endpoints like `/api/v1/admin/tsdb`, `/api/v1/insert`. |
| `SET_PROXY_HEADERS`         | `false`       | Whether to set proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`). |
| `SET_GOMAXPROCS`            | `true`        | Automatically set `GOMAXPROCS` to match Linux container CPU quota. |
| `DEBUG`                     | `false`       | Whether to print out debug log messages.                     |
| `LOG_FORMAT`                | `pretty`      | Log format (`pretty`, `json`)                                |
| `LOG_NO_COLOR`              | `false`       | Whether to disable colors for `pretty` format                |
| `LOG_REQUESTS`              | `false`       | Whether to log HTTP requests                                 |
| `PORT`                      | `8080`        | Port the web server will listen on.                          |
| `READ_TIMEOUT`              | `10s`         | `ReadTimeout` covers the time from when the connection is accepted to when the request body is fully read (if you do read the body, otherwise to the end of the headers). [More details](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-complete-guide-to-golang-net-http-timeouts/) |
| `WRITE_TIMEOUT`             | `10s`         | `WriteTimeout` normally covers the time from the end of the request header read to the end of the response write (a.k.a. the lifetime of the ServeHTTP). [More details](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-complete-guide-to-golang-net-http-timeouts/) |
| `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `20s`         | Maximum amount of time to wait for all connections to be closed. [More details](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server.Shutdown) |

(1*): since it's grafana who obtains jwt-tokens in the first place, the specified client id must also be present in the forwarded token (the `aud` claim).

### ACL

The file with ACL definitions (`./acl.yaml` by default) has a simple structure:

```yaml
role: namespace, namespace2
```

For example:

```yaml
team0: .*                # all metrics
team1: min.*, .*, stolon # all metrics, it's the same as .*
team2: minio             # only those with namespace="minio"
team3: min.*             # only those matching namespace=~"min.*"
team4: minio, stolon     # only those matching namespace=~"minio|stolon"
team5: min.*, stolon     # only those matching namespace=~"min.*|stolon"
```

To summarize, here are the key principles used for rewriting requests:

* `.*` - all requests are simply forwarded to an upstream;
* `minio` - all label filters with the `namespace` label are removed, then `namespace="minio"` is added;
* `min.*` -  positive regex-match label filters (`namespace=~"X"`) are removed, then `namespace=~"mi.*"` is added;
* `minio, stolon` - positive regex-match label filters (`namespace=~"X"`) are removed, then `namespace=~"minio|stolon"` is added;
* `min.*, stolon` - positive regex-match label filters (`namespace=~"X"`) are removed, then `namespace=~"min.*|stolon"` is added.

When deduplication is enabled, these queries will stay unmodified:

* `min.*, stolon`, query: `request_duration{namespace="minio"}` - a non-regexp label filter that matches policy;
* `min.*, stolon`, query: `request_duration{namespace=~"minio"}` - a "fake" regexp (no special symbols) label filter that matches policy;
* `min.*, stolon`, query: `request_duration{namespace=~"min.*"}` - a label filter is a subfilter of the policy.

Note: Regex matches are fully anchored. A match of `env=~"foo"` is treated as `env=~"^foo$"` ([Source](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)). Please, be careful, they are not expected to be used in ACLs.

Note: a user is free to have multiple roles matching the contents of `acl.yaml`. Basically, there are 3 cases:

* one role
  => a prepopulated LF is returned;
* multiple roles, one of which gives full access
  => a prepopulated LF, corresponding to the full access role, is returned;
* multiple "limited" roles
  => definitions of all those roles are merged together, and then lfgw generates a new LF. The process is the same as if this meta-definition was loaded through `acl.yaml`.

## Licensing

lfgw code is licensed under MIT, though its dependencies might have other licenses. Please, inspect the modules listed in [go.mod](go.mod) if needed.

## TODO

* improve naming;
* log slow requests;
* metrics;
* OIDC callback to support for proxying Prometheus web-interface itself;
* add a helm chart.
